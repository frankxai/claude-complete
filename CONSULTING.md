**Focus: Building Scalable Digital Products**

## Why Digital Products Instead of Consulting?

**Consulting:**
- Time for money (doesn't scale)
- Limited to hours in a day
- High price for 1 person

**Digital Products:**
- Build once, sell forever
- Help thousands of people
- Lower price, bigger impact
- True passive income
