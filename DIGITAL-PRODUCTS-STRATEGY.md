# Digital Products Strategy (Scalable Revenue)

**Build Once, Sell Forever - No Consulting, No Time Trading**

---

## Philosophy

**Time is finite. Digital products scale infinitely.**

- Record a course once → sell 1,000 times
- Build an agent pack once → sell forever
- Create a template once → passive income
- Build a community → recurring revenue

**Goal:** $10k MRR in 12 months, 100% passive/scalable income
