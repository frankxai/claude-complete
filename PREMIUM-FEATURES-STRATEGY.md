## Potential Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Fragmenting Community
**Mitigation:** Keep 80% free, 20% premium. Premium enhances, doesn't replace.

### Risk 2: Complexity Overload
**Mitigation:** Clear tiers, simple choices, progressive disclosure.

### Risk 3: Support Burden
**Mitigation:** Scale through documentation, community, and automated onboarding.

### Risk 4: Quality Concerns
**Mitigation:** Only ship premium when it's genuinely better than free.

### Risk 5: Competition
**Mitigation:** Move fast, stay unique (Oracle + AI niche), build moat through community.
