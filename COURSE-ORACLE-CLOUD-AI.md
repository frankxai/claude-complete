## Why This Course Exists

You won't find Oracle Cloud + Claude AI expertise anywhere else. I'm the **AI Architect at Oracle** and creator of the only comprehensive Claude Code ecosystem on GitHub with deep Oracle integration.

**The Problem:**
- Oracle Cloud has powerful AI services, but no one teaches how to integrate with Claude AI
- Enterprises waste months trying to connect Oracle infrastructure with modern AI workflows
- No systematic approach to automating Oracle Cloud with AI agents

**The Solution:**
This course teaches the exact system I use professionally at Oracle and in my consulting practice.
