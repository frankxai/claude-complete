## Why This Course Exists

AI music production is exploding, but **99% of creators are leaving money on the table.**

**The Problem:**
- Most people use Suno AI like a toy, getting mediocre results
- No systematic approach to commercial-quality production
- Missing the workflow automation that 10x's output
- No understanding of monetization strategies

**The Solution:**
I've produced 100+ AI tracks, generated revenue from AI music, and built the only Claude + Suno workflow automation system on GitHub. This course teaches my exact system.
