❌ **Building too much** - Start with one product, prove demand
❌ **Ignoring marketing** - 50% build, 50% marketing
❌ **Underpricing** - Your time and expertise are valuable
❌ **Getting distracted** - Focus on music first, expand later

✅ **Ship fast** - Done is better than perfect
✅ **Start small** - One product this week
✅ **Build in public** - Share the journey
✅ **Price confidently** - You're solving real problems
✅ **Focus** - Music → Creator Automation → Courses
